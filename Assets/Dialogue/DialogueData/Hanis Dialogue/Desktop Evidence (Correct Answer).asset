    Once the PC has been identified and
    prioritised in the triage phase, investigators will conduct a search for compelling
    evidence on the system. It is essential to prove the link between the evidence
    and suspect to ascertain that the individual is **responsible** for the incriminating
    data. As there could be multiple persons that have access to the machine, it
